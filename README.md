  <h2>My strengths and weaknesses</h2>
  <b>âž• I quickly learn new technologies.</b></br>
  Due to the fact that I have extensive project experience, I have learned to quickly adapt to new technologies and libraries.</br></br>
  <b>âž• I can effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.</b></br>
  More than once I had to explain to people involved in the project what we do and how it works.</br></br>
  <b>âž• If you delegate a task to me, you can be sure that it will be completed.</b></br>
  I appreciate the level of responsibility entrusted to me, so I do it justice.</br></br>
  <b>âž– High-quality code sometimes conflicts with rapid business deadlines.</b></br>
  Balancing high-code quality with rapid business deadlines is an ongoing challenge I'm actively working.</br></br>
  <b>âž– Hardly used git due to the distribution of tasks across modules and microservices.</b></br>
  This is one of my biggest mistakes.
